# Retail-Database
This is a real-world project for an online retail database where I use simple to very advanced SQL code for querying the data and for database management.

# Techniques Used
1. Joins: Joins were used on five tables for analysis.
2. Creation of a changelog table: I created a changelog table alongside triggers that fired whenever a trigger was...well, triggered.
3. Triggers/ Stored Procedures: To automatically log changes in the database, I used triggers in SQL Server. Triggers are special types of stored procedures that automatically execute in response to certain events on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
4. Indexes: Indexes are crucial for optimizing the performance of your SQL Server database, especially for read-heavy operations like SELECT queries.
5. Views: Views are virtual tables that represent the result of a query. They can simplify complex queries and enhance security by restricting access to specific data.
6. Security or Role-based User Control: To manage access control in SQL Server, you'll need to use a combination of SQL Server's security features, such as logins, users, roles, and permissions.
